Once upon a time, there lived a little boy whose name was Bill. He lived in a town called Happy Town. The town was full of happy people. His family was also a happy one. Their home was warm, cosy and happy. The school he went to was called Happy Days Primary School.
One day his cousing from Sadville came over to play. Bill wanted to show her his happy book collection, but she said reading made her sad. He then showed her his happy peanut butter jar, but she said peanuts made her sad too. Whatever Bill tried, he could just not do a thing to make his cousin happy.
